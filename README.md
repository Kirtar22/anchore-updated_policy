Updated Default Policy of Anchore 

If you are using Anchore OpenSource and would like to update your default policy with a policy which covers comprehensive checks by using available Gates & Triggers of Anchore then please download this policy and add it to your Anchore Engine. Then, run your checks against this new policy. 

Anchore is an opensource container security tool. https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine

It comes with a basic default policy which has a limited set of checks. However, Anchore is capable of covering variety of checks by modifying this default policy through various Gates and Triggers available as a aprt of the flexible configuration of Anchore. 

I have updated the default Anchore policy by using available Gates & Triggeres to make it more comprehensive by using almost all available Gates & Triggers in whicheverway possible. The Docker CIS Benchmark controls that can be tested through Anchore are also covered in this configuration.
